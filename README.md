### My graduation project

Medical Corner is a medical application which helps detecting Pneumonia and
Brain Tumour. It also provides prediction for Heart Disease
and Diabetes 

All models created using Neural Network

In this repository we will focus on Deep learning models



# Installation Options
### You can upload and run model using
- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org)
