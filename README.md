### My graduation project

- Medical Corner is a medical application which helps detecting Pneumonia and
Brain Tumour. It also provides prediction for Heart Disease
and Diabetes 

- All models created using Neural Network

- In this repository we will focus on Deep learning models

- I will upload the rest of the models


# Installation Options
### You can upload and run model using
- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org)

# Models on kaggle
[Pneumonia Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedkhaled7/pneumonia-detection-on-x-rays-using-cnn-and-tflite)
